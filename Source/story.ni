	say "Wake up, Count Dorklok! You are here. In the City. Eight hours of train travel almost made you forget why you are here in the first place. Let me remind you! The rent is not gonna pay itself and Chief Redd needs you to help him find out some information. You see, there has been a robbery - at the blood bank! There is only one suspect profile and you guessed it. It's a vampire. Now, why would they send you - a humble police station database manager - to such a mission? Well, you're the only nerd in the police station interested enough in all this vampiric stuff. Like, remember how you wore a cape and fake fangs in middle school? Or tried to sue Twilight Saga for false depiction? Anyhow, now you are a detective. You gotta find Grand Vampire and bring justice. Good luck!";
